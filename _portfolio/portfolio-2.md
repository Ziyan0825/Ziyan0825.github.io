## Details
• Used Hummer’s Method for the oxidation of graphite to GO, Solution-mixing Method for the preparation 
of GO and rGO / EP Nanocomposite and Spin coating for the film preparation.

• Material Characterisation Section: UV / Water Contact Angle / Scanning Electron Microscope / X-Ray 
Diffraction / Profiler / Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy / Atomic Force Microscopy.
